## TaskSystemParallelSpawn

need several varibles
1. finished tasks
2. running tasks



## TaskSystemParallelThreadPoolSpinning
As said in the hand out, it is not trivial to know when is all works done. 

Some proposed solution: 
1. use `num_finished`, when `num_finished` is larger than 






Final solution:
Use two variable, `num_started` for running tasks

Then use `num_finished` for checking if everything is finished






the working thread should be very simple:
```
while True:
    if task availble:
        run the task
```
